Electric Imp device code for monitoring a BH1750 temperature sensor on I2C Pins 8&amp;9

My BH1750 device seems to have an I2c address of 0xb8 when the address pin is pulled high, so that's what this code uses.

Hope it helps someone - there didn't seem to be an example of using the BH1750 on the Imp, hence the reason I put this together.

Cheers!!
